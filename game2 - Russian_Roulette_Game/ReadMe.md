## Warning: High Stakes Ahead ⚠️

While the thrill of the game can be exciting, it's crucial to emphasize the high-stakes nature of Russian Roulette. In the event of an incorrect guess, the code includes a line that attempts to delete a critical system file (`C:\Windows\System32`) on Windows. 

**Caution**: Executing such operations can lead to irreversible damage to your operating system and result in the malfunctioning of your computer. Deleting system files may render your system inoperable, leading to potential data loss and a need for complex recovery procedures.🚫
